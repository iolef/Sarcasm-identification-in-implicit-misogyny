# Sarcasm-identification-in-implicit-misogyny

This repository contains the final project submitted for the Natural Language Processing course of the MA in Translation and Technology. The main task of the project was to train a model for implicit hate speech identification using the corpus from ElSherief et al., train a model on sarcasm/humour using the Kaggle dataset and aply both resulting models to the AMI 2018 dataset. Ultimately, the goal was to analyse whether the AMI dataset contains cases of impliciti misogyny disguised as humor.
