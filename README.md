# Sarcasm-identification-in-implicit-misogyny

This repository contains the final project submitted for the Natural Language Processing course of the MA in Translation and Technology. We present the workflow to create two sentence detection models for the English language, one focused on recognizing implicit hate speech and one focused on recognizing humour. These models will be applied to a misogyny-annotated corpus in order to retrieve information concerning the presence of misogyny, implicit misogyny and misogyny disguised as humour in tweets.
